# VietBaguetteSimulation

ABSTRACT:

Academic:
As an aspiring UX designer with a special interest in cultural display media, I would like to implement a generative art program to simulate the structure of a Vietnamese baguette. The program is interactive by letting the user generate a random structure, rip the baguette structure apart, or pour over it some condensed milk . The objective is to provide an authentic visual abstraction of a baguette through gamifying its culinary experience, as inspired by my childhood relationship with this snack delicacy.
